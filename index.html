    <section class="lyrics">
        <p>Walkin' down 29th and Park,<br>
        <span class="aggressive">I saw you in another's arm</span>.<br>
        Only a month we've been apart,<br>
        <span class="happy">You look happier, you do.</span></p>
        <p>Ain't nobody hurt you like <span class="aggressive">I hurt you</span>,<br>
        But ain't nobody love you like <span class="romantic">I do</span>.<br>
        <span class="sad">Promise that I will not take it personal, baby,</span><br>
        <span class="sad">If you're movin' on with someone new, baby.</span></p>
        <p><span class="happy">You look happier, you do.</span><br>
        My friends told me one day I'll feel it too.<br>
        And until then,  <span class="friendly">I'll smile to hide the truth</span>.</p>
        <p>Sat in the corner of the room,<br>
         <span class="romantic"> Everything's reminding me of you</span>.<br>
        Nothing feels the same <span class="sad">without you,</span><br>
         <span class="happy">But I'm telling myself you're happier</span>.</p>
        <p>Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like <span class="aggressive">I hurt you</span>,<br>
        (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)<br>
        But ain't nobody need you like <span class="romantic">I do</span>.<br>
        (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)</p>
        <p><span class="sad">But I guess you look happier, you do.</span><br>
        <span class="romantic">My friends told me one day I'll feel it too.</span><br>
        And until then,  <span class="friendly">I'll smile to hide the truth</span>.</p>
